      <p>You know when you’re kind of lost, so you start following a couple people you encounter. Unbeknown to you the people you came across were already lost themselves  but decide someone else is going this way too so it must be right. Every step you’re taking is going the wrong way. How long does it take to realise? Only an hour or so, finally you realise you’re all lost. Backtrack it is, possibly one of my least favourite things. Well this day was one of those days.</p>
