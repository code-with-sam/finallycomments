# Finally Comments

The aim of this project is to promote the Steem ecosystem by breaking the comments system out of the walls of Steem based apps.

## Finally comments - V0.9.1
A embedable comments system built on the STEEM blockchain.

### How It Works
[Please visit the site for more detaails](http://finallycomments.com)

Finally is a comments system for blogs and website built on top of the STEEM blockchain. Similar to other popular plug and play comment systems Finally requires only a single html tag while our javascript library & backend system take care of the rest. The STEEM blockchain to provides posting and curation rewards to its users unlike any other comments system.

Login to the dashboard at [http://finallycomments.com](http://finallycomments.com/auth/dashboard). to generate code for any Steemit(or any other STEEM based platform) post with one click.
